Actually a better title would be WOWStick Bits Label for 3D a Printed Case, but it would be less WOW.

## The Gift

My brother-in-law is an amazing person: He is still alive after dealing with my wife for 16 years (and he still is), and he gives cool gifts. This year he got me a WOWStick 1F+.

It's really cool, I was really thinking of an IFixit tool kit but now my wallet is happy. It has some really nice features (from the original description):

- 56pcs screw bits.
- Slim S2 aluminum alloy housing body with pen shape design, easy to use.
- with Lithium-ion Battery Charge can work 8 hours continuously.
- With 3 LED Shadowless light, more convenient to do the repairing job.
- Equipped with magnetic board, holding the screws taken off from the reparing items, no screws lost
- Automatic and Manual operation design, ensure hight working efficiency
- Screwing, Drilling and Threading muti-function, meetiing your different woring demands
- A great Helper for your daily repairing projects

Some not so great features (or lack of) are:
- The original box, like a hot dog where one bad move and everything falls to the ground (forget taking that with you on your bag).
- The storage system for the bits. Whoever designed this must love Nicholas Cage in the movie "The Rock" because everytime you need a bit, you are saving America.

But, thingiverse to the rescue, the user [norkon](https://www.thingiverse.com/norkon/designs) designed an [amazing case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4700257) for the wowstick and this was also part of the gift.
This case it's perfect...almost, there's one thing missing, an order to the chaos that is...the position of the bits.
With the power of wikipedia for the SVG's of the bits, inkscape for the label design and the original bits order because i'm too lazy to think of a better layout, this is the result:

This label is small enough to fit on the rectangle of the cover and with just a piece of tape, you can glue it there.
This is an SVG file, so you can change the layout anyway you want.
There's also an A4 and Letter PDF for direct printing.
